- Acts as the **entry point** for the dashboard.  
- Contains **two navigation buttons**:  
  - **Production**  
  - **Consumption**  
- Shows **Top 5 Countries** by:  
  - Oil **Consumption**  
  - Oil **Reserves**  
  - Oil **Production**

## 📂 Dataset

The data comes from **Our World in Data** (public datasets):

- [Oil Reserves](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/oil-proved-reserves?country=~OWID_WRL)  
- [Oil Production](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/oil-production-by-region)  
- [Oil Consumption](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/oil-consumption-by-region-terawatt-hours-twh)  

These datasets were **transformed and modeled in Power BI** for storytelling and interactivity.
